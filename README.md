# 🔥 IoT Fire Sensor and Extinguisher 🚒  
An innovative IoT solution designed to detect fire hazards in real-time, trigger safety mechanisms, and alert users with audio-visual feedback. Stay protected, stay safe!  

---

## ✨ Features  
- **🔥 Real-Time Fire Detection**: Tracks temperature, gas levels, and light intensity to identify fire hazards.  
- **🔔 Safety Mechanisms**: Automatically activates a piezo buzzer and water pump to extinguish the fire.  
- **🌈 Visual Alerts**: Displays status with a NeoPixel LED strip (🟥 Red for danger, 🟩 Green for safe).  
- **📟 Real-Time Updates**: LCD screen notifies users with alerts like "ALERT!" or "SAFE".

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. 🔍 **Sensor Monitoring**: The system continuously reads values from temperature, gas, and light sensors.  
2. 🚨 **Alert Triggering**: If thresholds are breached:  
   - **Piezo Buzzer** rings.  
   - **Water Pump** activates to extinguish the fire.  
   - **NeoPixel LEDs** and **LCD Screen** provide real-time visual alerts.  
3. 🛡️ **Safety Restored**: Once conditions normalize, the system returns to a "SAFE" state.
